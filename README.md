**What is the Multi-Armed Bandit Problem (MABP)?**
A bandit is defined as someone who steals your money. A one-armed bandit is a simple slot machine wherein you insert a coin into the machine, pull a lever, and get an immediate reward. But why is it called a bandit? It turns out all casinos configure these slot machines in such a way that all gamblers end up losing money!

A multi-armed bandit is a complicated slot machine wherein instead of 1, there are several levers which a gambler can pull, with each lever giving a different return. The probability distribution for the reward corresponding to each lever is different and is unknown to the gambler.
